# Dynamic_Retail_Dashboard
The Dynamic Retail Dashboard is an interactive and data-driven tool built in Excel to visualize and analyze retail data. It connects hosted on Github, uses Power Query for data transformation, and presents insights through dynamic charts and KPIs. The dashboard solves key business questions, enabling informed decision-making.
## 🧠 Problem Statement

Retail companies like Walmart generate vast amounts of transactional data daily. However, this raw data is often underutilized due to a lack of intuitive tools. This dashboard was built to solve that problem by:

- Tracking key performance metrics like sales, profit, and order volume.
- Visualizing trends over time to inform strategic decisions.
- Enabling dynamic exploration of customer segments, markets, and product categories.

The goal was to design a **simple yet insightful Excel tool** for business users to interpret retail data without needing advanced tools or coding.
